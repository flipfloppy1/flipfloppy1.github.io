I have a passion for programming and the nitty-gritty of software development. I enjoy creative writing, game development and gaming in my free time.

The main project I'm focusing on at the moment is Ludus, a voxel game with exploration, combat, extensive simulation and lore. I'll blog about it from time to time. 
Its UI system, VidentiUI, is open-source and hosted [on github](https://github.com/flipfloppy1/VidentiUI). Feel free to take a look, offer suggestions and share!
